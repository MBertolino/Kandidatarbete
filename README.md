Bachelor thesis by Iliam Barkino and Mattias Bertolino spring 2015 at Uppsala University, IT-institutionen.

Project description:
In this study we investigate how regression analysis and moving average filters can be used to predict future return of an asset in order to invest in futures contracts. The backtracked investments were tested with risk-adjusted measures and evaluated thereafter.

For the regression, both OLS and ridge regression were used and the filter was swept in order to only use fresh data for the prediction.

Key learning points include:
1. Question why a certain predictor should be considered.
2. Design the filter(s) to match the characteristics of a certain variable.
